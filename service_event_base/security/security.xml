Security Groups Definition

PURPOSE:
    Define user groups for role-based access control (RBAC).
    Groups determine what users can see and do in the system.

ODOO SECURITY MODEL:
    Three-layer security:
    1. Groups: User role assignment (defined here)
    2. Access Rights: Model-level CRUD permissions (ir.model.access.csv)
    3. Record Rules: Row-level security filters (domain-based)

GROUP HIERARCHY:
    - Use category_id to organize related groups
    - Use implied_ids for inheritance (manager implies user)
    - Base groups on business roles, not technical permissions

WHY XML NOT PYTHON:
    - Declarative security is auditable
    - Can be easily reviewed and exported
    - Odoo provides UI for managing groups
    - Supports noupdate flag for customization

THIS FILE WILL BE COMPLETED IN COMMIT 5 (Security).
Placeholder created for manifest dependency.

<odoo>
    <data noupdate="0">
        <!--
        noupdate="0" means:
            - Data will be updated on module upgrade
            - Changes in XML will overwrite database
            - Used for critical security definitions
        
        noupdate="1" would mean:
            - Data only created on first install
            - User customizations preserved on upgrade
            - Used for demo data or default records
        -->
        
        <!-- Placeholder: Security groups will be defined in Commit 5 -->
