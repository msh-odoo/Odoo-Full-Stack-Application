Demo Data - Placeholder

PURPOSE:
    Sample data for testing and demonstration.
    Only loaded when Odoo runs with demo mode.

DEMO vs REGULAR DATA:
    - Regular data (data/): Always loaded (categories, sequences)
    - Demo data (demo/): Only loaded in demo mode

WHY DEMO DATA:
    - Pre-populate system for testing
    - Showcase features to potential users
    - Enable UI tests without manual data entry
    - Never loaded in production

THIS FILE WILL BE POPULATED in later commits with sample services and bookings.
