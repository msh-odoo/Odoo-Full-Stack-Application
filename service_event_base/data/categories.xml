Service Event Categories Data

PURPOSE:
    Default service categories created during installation.
    Populated by post_init_hook, this file is a placeholder.

WHY BOTH HOOK AND XML:
    - Hook creates categories programmatically (dynamic, conditional)
    - XML could also create categories (declarative, static)
    - We use hook to demonstrate post_init_hook usage
    - XML alternative shown here for reference

TRADE-OFFS:
    Hook approach:
        ✓ Can check existence before creating (idempotent)
        ✓ Can use complex logic (conditions, loops)
        ✓ Centralized in Python code
        ✗ Not visible in XML (less transparent)
        ✗ Requires Python knowledge to modify
    
    XML approach:
        ✓ Declarative and visible
        ✓ Easy to modify without Python
        ✓ Odoo handles duplicate detection with xml_id
        ✗ No conditional logic
        ✗ Static data only

BEST PRACTICE:
    - Simple master data: Use XML with noupdate="1"
    - Complex initialization: Use post_init_hook
    - This module: Uses hook to demonstrate lifecycle concepts

WHAT IS ir.model.data:
    Odoo's registry of XML IDs → database IDs.
    When you create a record with id="category_workshop":
        1. Odoo creates the record in service_event_category table
        2. Odoo creates an entry in ir_model_data linking:
           - module: service_event_base
           - name: category_workshop
           - model: service.event.category
           - res_id: actual database ID
    
    WHY ir.model.data:
        - Enables referencing records across modules
        - Prevents duplicate creation on reinstall
        - Allows record lookup by XML ID
        - Powers module upgrade and dependency resolution
    
    EXAMPLE:
        self.env.ref('service_event_base.category_workshop')
        → Returns the actual record object

NOTE: Categories are created in hooks.py post_init_hook.
      This file is kept for potential manual category additions.

<odoo>
    <data noupdate="1">
        <!--
        noupdate="1" because:
            - Users may rename or customize categories
            - Don't overwrite customizations on upgrade
            - Categories created by hook anyway
        -->
        
        <!-- Categories are created by post_init_hook -->
